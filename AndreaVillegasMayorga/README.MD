**Task Status**

* Done

**Problems encountered and how was it resolved**
 
 * A big problem that I found during the starting learning process of python was learning it with and without Django. When I first started I did not do the set up of the code correctly as I was only using plain python. As I dived into more and more tutorials I found myself more aware of the use of django. 
 * When working starting to work on the ERD diagrams, not having the full picture of all the tables my other team members were creating was challenging as I was not fully sure how my feature database wise was going to be driven. As we combined our ERD it became clearer how the features worked off each other.
 
## Task List

* Week 2 
    - [x] Set up group project
    - [x] Get started with invoices page


**Task Status**

* Done

**Problems encountered and how was it resolved**
 
 * Since the invoices uses many foreign keys and references other tables, it was complicated to set up a database, and practice adding information into it as there were no other tables to build off from.
