# PyTrackr: Work Tracking System
A freelance work tracking system, with a timer that can track hours and holds a total that the user could charge for that work. Could also hold tasks and upcoming projects, for task management

## Features

### Feature 1 - Timer System
The app will include a timer that has a Start and a Stop button. The running timer tracks the amount of time that is spent on one task, and each task has a timer connected to it so you can track how much time is being spent per task. The tasks will have a schedule option so that users can budget how much time is allotted to a task, and when they are nearing their budgeted time, the timer will notify them. The timer will also notify users for wellness checks, including a timed break and a notification reminding users to move their eyes from the screen to avoid eye strain.

### Feature 2 -Task & Project Dashboard
Tasks can be added, edited, and deleted from the task management system. They will also be able to be grouped into a project, so specific projects can have specific tasks assigned to them. These will display when users click into a project, so they can see all of the tasks assigned to a specific project. When the taskboard is displayed, the user can see the task name, due date, priority, and hour allotment. When they click into a task, they can see more details including task notes, the timer start button, and the amount of time already spent on the task (if any).
